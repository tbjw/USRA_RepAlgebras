  abstract = {This book consists of three parts, rather different in level and purpose: The first part was originally written for quantum chemists. It describes the correspondence, due to Frobenius, between linear representations and charac ters. This is a fundamental result, of constant use in mathematics as well as in quantum chemistry or physics. I have tried to give proofs as elementary as possible, using only the definition of a group and the rudiments of linear algebra. The examples (Chapter 5) have been chosen from those useful to chemists. The second part is a course given in 1966 to second-year students of I'Ecoie Normale. It completes the first on the following points: (a) degrees of representations and integrality properties of characters (Chapter 6); (b) induced representations, theorems of Artin and Brauer, and applications (Chapters 7-11); (c) rationality questions (Chapters 12 and 13). The methods used are those of linear algebra (in a wider sense than in the first part): group algebras, modules, noncommutative tensor products, semisimple algebras. The third part is an introduction to Brauer theory: passage from characteristic 0 to characteristic p (and conversely). I have freely used the language of abelian categories (projective modules, Grothendieck groups), which is well suited to this sort of question. The principal results are: (a) The fact that the decomposition homomorphism is surjective: all irreducible representations in characteristic p can be lifted "virtually" (i.e., in a suitable Grothendieck group) to characteristic O.;This book consists of three parts, rather different in level and purpose: The first part was originally written for quantum chemists.

  abstract = {Hyperbolic Manifolds and Discrete Groups is at the crossroads of several branches of mathematics: hyperbolic geometry, discrete groups, 3-dimensional topology, geometric group theory, and complex analysis. The main focus throughout the text is on the "Big Monster," i.e., on Thurston's hyperbolization theorem, which has not only completely changes the landscape of 3-dimensinal topology and Kleinian group theory but is one of the central results of 3-dimensional topology. The book is fairly self-contained, replete with beautiful illustrations, a rich set of examples of key concepts, numerous exercises, and an extensive bibliography and index. It should serve as an ideal graduate course/seminar text or as a comprehensive reference.;This classic book is at the crossroads of several branches of mathematics: hyperbolic geometry, discrete groups, 3-dimensional topology, geometric group theory, and complex analysis. The main focus throughout the text is on Thurston's hyperbolization theorem, one of the central results of 3-dimensional topology that has completely changed the landscape of the field. The book contains a number of open problems and conjectures related to the hyperbolization theorem as well as rich discussions on related topics including geometric structures on 3-manifolds, higher dimensional negatively curved manifolds, and hyperbolic groups. Featuring beautiful illustrations, a rich set of examples, numerous exercises, and an extensive bibliography and index, Hyperbolic Manifolds and Discrete Groups continues to serve as an ideal graduate text and comprehensive reference. The book is very clearly written and fairly self-contained. It will be useful to researchers and advanced graduate students in the field and can serve as an ideal guide to Thurston's work and its recent developments. ---Mathematical Reviews Beyond the hyperbolization theorem, this is an important book which had to be written, some parts are still technical and will certainly be streamlined and shortened in the next years, but together with Otal's work a complete published proof of the hyperbolization theorem is finally available. Apart from the proof itself, the book contains a lot of material which will be useful for various other directions of research. ---Zentralbatt MATH This book can act as source material for a postgraduate course and as a reference text on the topic as the references are full and extensive. . The text is self-contained and very well illustrated. ---ASLIB Book Guide;},
