  abstract = {According to Cayley's tree formula, there are n(n-2) labelled trees on n vertices. Prufer gave a bijection between the set of labelled trees on n vertices and sequences of n-2 numbers, each in the range 1, 2,..., n. Such a number sequence is called a Prufer code. The straightforward implementation of his bijection takes O(n log n) time. In this paper we propose an O(n) time algorithm for the same problem. Our algorithm can be easily parallelized so that a Prufer code can be generated in O(log n) time using O(n) processors on the EREW PRAM computational model.},

This is an algebraic analogue of the notion of a local isomorphism in the complex analytic topology.  They satisfy the hypotheses of the implicit function theorem, but because open sets in the Zariski topology are so large, they are not necessarily local isomorphisms.  Despite this, \'etale maps retain many of the properties of local analytic isomorphisms, and are useful in defining the algebraic fundamental group and the \'etale topology. The word \'etale is a French adjective, which means "slack", as in "slack tide", or, figuratively, calm, immobile, something left to settle.},

  abstract = {The cohomology of groups has, since its beginnings in the 1920s and 1930s, been the stage for significant interaction between algebra and topology and has led to the creation of important new fields in mathematics, like homological algebra and algebraic K-theory. This is the first book to deal comprehensively with the cohomology of finite groups: it introduces the most important and useful algebraic and topological techniques, describing the interplay of the subject with those of homotopy theory, representation theory and group actions. The combination of theory and examples, together with the techniques for computing the cohomology of various important classes of groups, and several of the sporadic simple groups, enables readers to acquire an in-depth understanding of group cohomology and its extensive applications. The 2nd edition contains many more mod 2 cohomology calculations for the sporadic simple groups, obtained by the authors and with their collaborators over the past decade. -Chapter III on group cohomology and invariant theory has been revised and expanded. New references arising from recent developments in the field have been added, and the index substantially enlarged.;Some Historical Background This book deals with the cohomology of groups, particularly finite ones. Historically, the subject has been one of significant interaction between algebra and topology and has directly led to the creation of such important areas of mathematics as homo- logical algebra and algebraic K-theory. It arose primarily in the 1920's and 1930's independently in number theory and topology. In topology the main focus was on the work ofH. Hopf, but B. Eckmann, S. Eilenberg, and S. MacLane (among others) made significant contributions. The main thrust of the early work here was to try to understand the meanings of the low dimensional homology groups of a space X. For example, if the universal cover of X was three connected, it was known that H2(X; A. ) depends only on the fundamental group of X. Group cohomology initially appeared to explain this dependence. In number theory, group cohomology arose as a natural device for describing the main theorems of class field theory and, in particular, for describing and analyzing the Brauer group of a field. It also arose naturally in the study of group extensions, N;},

  abstract = {Let G denote a topological group. In this paper the descending central series of free groups are used to construct simplicial spaces of homomorphisms with geometric realizations B(q, G) that provide a filtration of the classifying space BG. In particular this setting gives rise to a single space constructed out of all the spaces of ordered commuting n\textendash tuples of elements in G. Basic properties of these constructions are discussed, including the homotopy type and cohomology when the group G is either a finite group or a compact connected Lie group. For a finite group the construction gives rise to a covering space with monodromy related to a delicate result in group theory equivalent to the odd-order theorem of Feit\textendash Thompson. The techniques here also yield a counting formula for the cardinality of Hom({$\pi$}, G) where {$\pi$} is any descending central series quotient of a finitely generated free group. Another application is the determination of the structure of the spaces B(2, G) obtained from commuting n-tuples in G for finite groups such that the centralizer of every non\textendash central element is abelian (known as transitively commutative groups), which played a key role in work by Suzuki on the structure of finite simple groups.},

  abstract = {We extend the theory of Thom spectra and the associated obstruction theory for orientations in order to support the construction of the E{$\infty$} string orientation of tmf, the spectrum of topological modular forms. Specifically, we show that, for an E{$\infty$} ring spectrum A, the classical construction of gl1A, the spectrum of units, is the right adjoint of the functor {$\Sigma$}+{$\infty\Omega\infty$}:ho(connectivespectra)?ho(E{$\infty$}ringspectra). To a map of spectra f:b?bgl1A, we associate an E{$\infty$} A?algebra Thom spectrum Mf, which admits an E{$\infty$} A?algebra map to R if and only if the composition b?bgl1A?bgl1R is null; the classical case developed by May, Quinn, Ray, and Tornehave arises when A is the sphere spectrum. We develop the analogous theory for A{$\infty$} ring spectra: if A is an A{$\infty$} ring spectrum, then to a map of spaces f:B?BGL1A, we associate an A?module Thom spectrum Mf, which admits an R?orientation if and only if B?BGL1A?BGL1R is null. Our work is based on a new model of the Thom spectrum as a derived smash product.},

The period-index problem is to relate the order of a class in the Brauer group to the degrees of Azumaya algebras representing it. For any space of dimension d, we give upper bounds on the index depending only on d and the order of the class. By the Oka principle, this also solves the period-index problem for the analytic Brauer group of any Stein space that has the homotopy type of a finite CW-complex. Our methods use twisted topological K-theory, which was first introduced by Donovan and Karoubi. We also study the cohomology of the projective unitary groups to give cohomological obstructions to a class being represented by an Azumaya algebra of degree n. Applying this to the finite skeleta of the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z/l,2), where l is a prime, we construct a sequence of spaces with an order l class in Br, but whose indices tend to infinity.},

As a consequence we deduce that cancellation holds for rank \$2\$ vector bundles on such varieties. The proofs of these results involve three main ingredients. First, we give a description of the first non-stable \$\{\textbackslash mathbb A\}\^1\$-homotopy sheaf of the symplectic group. Second, these computations can be used in concert with F. Morel's \$\{\textbackslash mathbb A\}\^1\$-homotopy classification of vector bundles on smooth affine schemes and obstruction theoretic techniques (stemming from a version of the Postnikov tower in \$\{\textbackslash mathbb A\}\^1\$-homotopy theory) to reduce the classification results to cohomology vanishing statements. Third, we prove the required vanishing statements.},

As a byproduct, we describe the Chow group of zero cycles on a smooth affine \$k\$-scheme as the quotient of the free abelian group on zero cycles by the subgroup generated by reduced complete intersection ideals; this answers a question of S.

We review Zorn's "vector matrix" construction of octonion algebras, generalized to rings by various authors, and show that generically split octonion algebras are always obtained from this construction over smooth affine schemes of low dimension. Finally, generalizing P. Gille's analysis of octonion algebras with trivial norm form, we observe that generically split octonion algebras with trivial associated spinor bundle are automatically split in low dimensions.},

A necessary condition for a complex topological vector bundle on {$\mathsl{X}$}XX (viewed as a complex manifold) to be algebraic is that all Chern classes must be algebraic cohomology classes, that is, lie in the image of the cycle class map. We analyze the question of whether algebraicity of Chern classes is sufficient to guarantee algebraizability of complex topological vector bundles. For affine varieties of dimension {$\leqslant$}3{$\leqslant$}3\{\textbackslash leqslant\}3, it is known that algebraicity of Chern classes of a vector bundle guarantees algebraizability of the vector bundle. In contrast, we show in dimension {$\geqslant$}4{$\geqslant$}4\{\textbackslash geqslant\}4 that algebraicity of Chern classes is insufficient to guarantee algebraizability of vector bundles. To do this, we construct a new obstruction to algebraizability using Steenrod operations on Chow groups. By means of an explicit example, we observe that our obstruction is nontrivial in general.},

Here, we prove that for smooth curves over a local field or surfaces over a finite field, replacing the Witt group by the total Witt group of all line bundle-valued quadratic forms recovers Merkurjev's theorem: the 2-torsion of the Brauer group is always represented by even Clifford algebras of line bundle-valued quadratic forms.},

For a strictly homotopy invariant sheaf \$M\$, smooth \$k\$-scheme \$X\$ and \$q \textbackslash geqslant 0\$ we construct a novel cycle complex \$C\^*(X, M, q)\$ and we prove that in favorable cases, \$C\^*(X, M, q)\$ is equivalent to the homotopy coniveau tower \$M\^\{(q)\}(X)\$. To do so we establish moving lemmas for the Rost-Schmid complex. As an application we deduce a cycle complex model for Milnor-Witt motivic cohomology. Furthermore we prove that if \$M\$ is a strictly homotopy invariant sheaf, then \$M\_\{-2\}\$ is a homotopy module. Finally we conjecture that for \$q{$>$}0\$, \$\textbackslash underline\{\textbackslash pi\}\_0(M\^\{(q)\})\$ is a homotopy module, explain the significance of this conjecture for studying conservativity properties of the \$\textbackslash mathbb\{G\}\_m\$-stabilization functor \$\textbackslash mathcal\{SH\}\^\{S\^1\}\textbackslash!(k) \textbackslash to \textbackslash mathcal\{SH\}(k)\$, and provide some evidence for the conjecture.},

  abstract = {Compactness in topology and finite generation in algebra are nice properties to start with. However, the study of compact spaces leads naturally to non-compact spaces and infinitely generated chain complexes; a classical example is the theory of covering spaces. In handling non-compact spaces we must take into account the infinity behaviour of such spaces. This necessitates modifying the usual topological and algebraic cate gories to obtain "proper" categories in which objects are equipped with a "topologized infinity" and in which morphisms are compatible with the topology at infinity. The origins of proper (topological) category theory go back to 1923, when Kere kjart6 [VT] established the classification of non-compact surfaces by adding to orien tability and genus a new invariant, consisting of a set of "ideal points" at infinity. Later, Freudenthal [ETR] gave a rigorous treatment of the topology of "ideal points" by introducing the space of "ends" of a non-compact space. In spite of its early ap pearance, proper category theory was not recognized as a distinct area of topology until the late 1960's with the work of Siebenmann [OFB], [IS], [DES] on non-compact manifolds.},

The results can be interpreted as positive answers to questions on equivalences of p-blocks of group algebras in the case that the block is the group algebra of a p-group. Let E be the extraspecial p-group of order p3{$<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}3{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}/math{$>$} and exponent p where p is an odd prime. We determine the mod p cohomology of summands in the stable splitting of p-completed classifying space BE modulo nilpotence. It is well known that indecomposable summands in the complete stable splitting correspond to simple modules for the mod p double Burnside algebra. We shall use representation theory of the double Burnside algebra and the theory of biset functors. Let G{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}G{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} be a finite group and let k{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}k{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} be a field. Our purpose is to investigate the simple modules for the double Burnside ring kB(G,G){$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}k{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}G{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}G{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}. It turns out that they are evaluations at G{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}G{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} of simple biset functors. For a fixed finite group H{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}H{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}, we introduce a suitable bilinear form on kB(G,H){$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}k{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}G{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}H{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} and we prove that the quotient of kB(-,H){$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}k{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>-<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}H{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} by the radical of the bilinear form is a semi-simple functor. This allows for a description of the evaluation of simple functors, hence of simple modules for the double Burnside ring. We formulate and prove a new variant of the Segal conjecture describing the group of homotopy classes of stable maps from the p-completed classifying space of a finite group G to the classifying space of a compact Lie group K as the p-adic completion of the Grothendieck group Ap(G,K){$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}/msub{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}G{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}K{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/math{$>$} of finite principal (G,K){$<$}math{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}G{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}K{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/math{$>$}-bundles whose isotropy groups are p-groups. Collecting the result for different primes p, we get a new and simple description of the group of homotopy classes of stable maps between (uncompleted) classifying spaces of groups. This description allows us to determine the kernel of the map from the Grothendieck group A(G,K){$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}G{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}K{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/math{$>$} of finite principal (G,K){$<$}math{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}G{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}K{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/math{$>$}-bundles to the group of homotopy classes of stable maps from BG to BK. We give an alternative to the stable classification of p-completed homotopy types of classifying spaces of finite groups offered by Martino\textendash Priddy. For a finite group G with Sylow subgroup S, we regard the stable p-completed classifying space {$\Sigma\infty$}BGp{$\wedge<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Sigma<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\infty<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}msubsup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="italic"{$>$}BG{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\wedge<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msubsup{$><$}/math{$>$} as an object under {$\Sigma\infty$}BS{$<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Sigma<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\infty<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="italic"{$>$}BS{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} via the canonical inclusion map. Thus we get a classification in terms of induced fusion systems. Applying Oliver's solution to the Martino\textendash Priddy conjecture, we obtain the surprising result that the unstable homotopy type of BGp{$\wedge<$}math{$><$}msubsup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="italic"{$>$}BG{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\wedge<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msubsup{$><$}/math{$>$} is determined by the map {$\Sigma\infty$}BS\textrightarrow{$\Sigma\infty$}BGp{$\wedge<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Sigma<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\infty<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="italic"{$>$}BS{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\rightarrow <$}/mo{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Sigma<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\infty<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}msubsup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="italic"{$>$}BG{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\wedge<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msubsup{$><$}/math{$>$}, but not by the homotopy type of {$\Sigma\infty$}BGp{$\wedge<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Sigma<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\infty<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}msubsup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="italic"{$>$}BG{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\wedge<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msubsup{$><$}/math{$>$}.},

  abstract = {Recently Freed and Hopkins [11] proved that there is no parity anomaly in M-theory on pin+ manifolds in the low-energy field theory approximation, and they also developed an algebraic theory of cubic forms.

We relate them to {$\eta$}-invariants when the manifolds are with boundary, and mod 2 indices on 10 dimensional characteristic submanifolds when the manifolds are spinc or spin{$\omega$}2{$<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\omega<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}2{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}/math{$>$}. Our method of producing these cubic forms is a combination of (generalized) Witten classes and the character of the basic representation of affine E8{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}8{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}. String structures have played an important role in algebraic topology, via elliptic genera and elliptic cohomology, in differential geometry, via the study of higher geometric structures, and in physics, via partition functions. We extend the description of String structures from connected covers of the definite-signature orthogonal group O(n){$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{$>$}O{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}n{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} to the indefinite-signature orthogonal group O(p,q){$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{$>$}O{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}, i.e. from the Riemannian to the pseudo-Riemannian setting. This requires that we work at the unstable level, which makes the discussion more subtle than the stable case. Similar, but much simpler, constructions hold for other noncompact Lie groups such as the unitary group U(p,q){$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{$>$}U{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} and the symplectic group Sp(p,q){$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true" mathvariant="normal"{$>$}Sp{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}p{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$},{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}.

  abstract = {The purpose of this work is to give a definition of a topological K-theory for dg-categories over  C\textbackslash mathbb\{C\}  and to prove that the Chern character map from algebraic K-theory to periodic cyclic homology descends naturally to this new invariant. This topological Chern map provides a natural candidate for the existence of a rational structure on the periodic cyclic homology of a smooth proper dg-algebra, within the theory of noncommutative Hodge structures. The definition of topological K-theory consists in two steps: taking the topological realization of algebraic K-theory and inverting the Bott element. The topological realization is the left Kan extension of the functor `space of complex points' to all simplicial presheaves over complex algebraic varieties. Our first main result states that the topological K-theory of the unit dg-category is the spectrum  BU\textbackslash mathbf\{BU\} . For this we are led to prove a homotopical generalization of Deligne's cohomological proper descent, using Lurie's proper descent. The fact that the Chern character descends to topological K-theory is established by using Kassel's K\"unneth formula for periodic cyclic homology and the proper descent. In the case of a dg-category of perfect complexes on a separated scheme of finite type, we show that we recover the usual topological K-theory of complex points. We show as well that the Chern map tensorized with  C\textbackslash mathbb\{C\}  is an equivalence in the case of a finite-dimensional associative algebra \textendash{} providing a formula for the periodic homology groups in terms of the stack of finite-dimensional modules.},

Several clinical examples are given to illustrate these differences, and failure to distinguish between them is seen to be problematic. Common misinterpretations of values are explained. Confidence intervals provide essential information where P-values are deficient in doing so and they therefore play an essential role in reporting and interpreting study results.},

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new notion of weight structure (w) for a triangulated category C; this notion is an important natural counterpart of the notion of t-structure. It allows extending several results of the preceding paper [Bon09] to a large class of triangulated categories and functors.The heart of w is an additive category Hw {$\subset$} C. We prove that a weight structure yields Postnikov towers for any X {$\in$} ObjC (whose 'factors' Xi {$\in$} ObjHw). For any (co)homological functor H : C \textrightarrow{} A (A is abelian) such a tower yields a weight spectral sequenceT : H(Xi [j]) {$\Rightarrow$} H(X[i + j]); T is canonical and functorial in X starting from E2. T specializes to the usual (Deligne) weight spectral sequences for 'classical' realizations of Voevodsky's motives DMeffgm (if we consider w = wChow with Hw = Choweff ) and to Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences in topology.We prove that there often exists an exact conservative weight complex functor C \textrightarrow{} K(Hw). This is a generalization of the functor t : DMeffgm \textrightarrow{} Kb(Choweff) constructed in [Bon09] (which is an extension of the weight complex of Gillet and Soul\'e). We prove that K0(C) {$\cong$} K0(Hw) under certain restrictions.We also introduce the concept of adjacent structures: a t-structure is adjacent to w if their negative parts coincide. This is the case for the Postnikov t-structure for the stable homotopy category SH (of topological spectra) and a certain weight structure for it that corresponds to the cellular filtration. We also define a new (Chow) t-structure tChow for DMeff\_ {$\supset$} DMeffgm which is adjacent to the Chow weight structure. We have HtChow {$\cong$} AddFun(Choweffop,Ab); tChow is related to unramified cohomology. Functors left adjoint to those that are t-exact with respect to some t-structures are weight-exact with respect to the corresponding adjacent weight structures, and vice versa. Adjacent structures identify two spectral sequences converging to C(X,Y): the one that comes from weight truncations of X with the one coming from t-truncations of Y (for X,Y {$\in$} ObjC). Moreover, the philosophy of adjacent structures allows expressing torsion motivic cohomology of certain motives in terms of the \'etale cohomology of their 'submotives'. This is an extension of the calculation of E2 of coniveau spectral sequences (by Bloch and Ogus).},

  abstract = {This book is primarily concerned with the study of cohomology theories of general topological spaces with "general coefficient systems. " Sheaves play several roles in this study. For example, they provide a suitable notion of "general coefficient systems. " Moreover, they furnish us with a common method of defining various cohomology theories and of comparison between different cohomology theories. The parts of the theory of sheaves covered here are those areas impor\- tant to algebraic topology. Sheaf theory is also important in other fields of mathematics, notably algebraic geometry, but that is outside the scope of the present book. Thus a more descriptive title for this book might have been Algebraic Topology from the Point of View of Sheaf Theory. Several innovations will be found in this book. Notably, the con\- cept of the "tautness" of a subspace (an adaptation of an analogous no\- tion of Spanier to sheaf-theoretic cohomology) is introduced and exploited throughout the book. The fact that sheaf-theoretic cohomology satisfies 1 the homotopy property is proved for general topological spaces. Also, relative cohomology is introduced into sheaf theory. Concerning relative cohomology, it should be noted that sheaf-theoretic cohomology is usually considered as a "single space" theory.},

We have chosen a geometrical and analytical approach since we feel that this is the easiest way to motivate and establish the theory and to indicate relations to other branches of mathematics. Lie algebras, though mentioned occasionally, are not used in an essential way. The material as well as its presentation are classical; one might say that the foundations were known to Hermann Weyl at least 50 years ago. Prerequisites to the book are standard linear algebra and analysis, including Stokes' theorem for manifolds. The book can be read by German students in their third year, or by first-year graduate students in the United States. Generally speaking the book should be useful for mathematicians with geometric interests and, we hope, for physicists. At the end of each section the reader will find a set of exercises. These vary in character: Some ask the reader to verify statements used in the text, some contain additional information, and some present examples and counter\- examples. We advise the reader at least to read through the exercises.},

The hairs transduce air motion to the neuron signal that is used by a cricket to respond to the environment. We stratify the hairs (and the corresponding afferent terminals) into classes depending on hair length, along with position. Our analysis uncovers significant structure in the relative position of these terminal classes and suggests the functional relevance of this structure. Our method is very robust to the presence of significant experimental and developmental noise. It can be used to analyze a wide range of other point cloud data sets.},

In the past decade, developments in graph theory have provided many new methods for topologically analysing complex networks, some of which have already been translated to the characterization of anatomical and functional brain networks.Anatomical networks at whole-brain and cellular scales in several species consistently demonstrate conservation of wiring costs and small-world topology (high clustering and short path length). Human brain anatomical networks, derived from MRI or diffusion tensor imaging data, have high-degree cortical 'hubs' and modular and hierarchical properties.Functional networks also demonstrate small-world properties at whole-brain and cellular spatial scales. Additionally, complex network properties including small-worldness and the existence of hubs are conserved over different frequency scales in functional MRI and electrophysiological data.Convergent experimental and computational data suggest that there is interdependence in the organization of structural and functional networks. The topology, synchronizability and other dynamic properties of functional networks are strongly affected by small-world and other metrics of structural connectivity. Conversely, over a slower timescale the dynamics can modulate structural network topology.Neuropsychiatric disorders can be thought of as dysconnectivity syndromes, and graph theory has already been used to quantify abnormality of structural and functional network properties in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. Graph theory can help us to understand the vulnerability of brain networks to lesions and could in future be used to provide markers of genetic risk for disorders or to measure therapeutic effects of drug treatments on functional networks.The network organization of the brain, as it is beginning to be revealed by graph theory, is compatible with the hypothesis that the brain, perhaps in common with other complex networks, has evolved both to maximize the efficiency of information transfer and to minimize connection cost, at all scales of space and time. Key issues for future work include clarifying the relationship between the brain's network properties and its emergent cognitive behaviours in health and disease.},

@inproceedings{Carlson,
  title = {{{COHOMOLOGY AND REPRESENTATION THEORY}}},
  author = {Carlson, Jon F.},
  abstract = {In these lectures we shall consider a few aspects of the interaction between group cohomology and group representation theory. That interaction has grown tremendously in the last thirty years to the point that homological methods are now standard in modular representation theory. The subject is much too large to give a complete picture in the space of a half semester of lectures. Consequently, we will concentrate on the methods and results required for one application: the classification of endotrivial modules. The classification is a statement about modules over group algebras and makes almost no mention of homological algebra or cohomology. Yet its proof relies in fundamental ways on the theory of support varieties, on the computations of the cohomology rings of extraspecial groups and on several other items from group cohomology. The endotrivial module were introduce by Dade in [22], who showed them to be the building blocks for the endopermutation modules. The endopermutation module are the sources for the simple module for p-solvable groups [28] and are also of interest in block theory and categorical equivalences [14]. Dade also proved a classification for the endotrivial modules for an abelian p-group. Puig [29] showed that the group of endotrivial modules is finitely generated. Following those beginnings there was a long period with no big progress. Then in the middle 1990's, Alperin [1] found the torsion free rank of the group of endotrivial modules. Alperin's result was proved independently by Bouc and Th\'evenaz [10]. A few years later, Th\'evenaz and the author [15, 16, 17] characterized the torsion part of the group and showed that Alperin's generators, indeed, generated the torsion free part. Another collection of generators was constructed in [13]. Very recently, Bouc [9] has used the classification of endotrivial modules to complete a characterization of the Dade group of endopermutation modules of a p-group. There has also been some progress made on classifying the endotrivial modules for groups which are not p-groups [19]. A key point in the proof of the classification of endotrivial modules was the development of an effective method of computing an upper bound for the dimensions of endotrivial modules based on group cohomology. This method relies on an explicit proof of Quillen's Dimension Theorem in terms of the vanishing of certain cohomology products. The proof first appeared in [12] and we present some part of it in Section 5.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop homotopy theoretical methods for studying diagrams. In particular we explain how to construct homotopy colimits and limits in an arbitrary model category. The key concept we introduce is that of a model approximation. A model approximation of a category \$\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\$ with a given class of weak equivalences is a model category \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\$ together with a pair of adjoint functors \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\} \textbackslash rightleftarrows \textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\$ which satisfy certain properties. Our key result says that if \$\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\$ admits a model approximation then so does the functor category \$Fun(I, \textbackslash mathcal\{C\})\$. From the homotopy theoretical point of view categories with model approximations have similar properties to those of model categories. They admit homotopy categories (localizations with respect to weak equivalences). They also can be used to construct derived functors by taking the analogs of fibrant and cofibrant replacements. A category with weak equivalences can have several useful model approximations. We take advantage of this possibility and in each situation choose one that suits our needs. In this way we prove all the fundamental properties of the homotopy colimit and limit: Fubini Theorem (the homotopy colimit -respectively limit- commutes with itself), Thomason's theorem about diagrams indexed by Grothendieck constructions, and cofinality statements. Since the model approximations we present here consist of certain functors ``indexed by spaces'', the key role in all our arguments is played by the geometric nature of the indexing categories.},

  abstract = {This monograph provides a systematic treatment of the Brauer group of schemes, from the foundational work of Grothendieck to recent applications in arithmetic and algebraic geometry. The importance of the cohomological Brauer group for applications to Diophantine equations and algebraic geometry was discovered soon after this group was introduced by Grothendieck. The Brauer-Manin obstruction plays a crucial role in the study of rational points on varieties over global fields. The birational invariance of the Brauer group was recently used in a novel way to establish the irrationality of many new classes of algebraic varieties. The book covers the vast theory underpinning these and other applications. Intended as an introduction to cohomological methods in algebraic geometry, most of the book is accessible to readers with a knowledge of algebra, algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory at graduate level. Much of the more advanced material is not readily available in book form elsewhere; notably, de Jong's proof of Gabber's theorem, the specialisation method and applications of the Brauer group to rationality questions, an in-depth study of the Brauer-Manin obstruction, and proof of the finiteness theorem for the Brauer group of abelian varieties and K3 surfaces over finitely generated fields. The book surveys recent work but also gives detailed proofs of basic theorems, maintaining a balance between general theory and concrete examples. Over half a century after Grothendieck's foundational seminars on the topic, The Brauer-Grothendieck Group is a treatise that fills a longstanding gap in the literature, providing researchers, including research students, with a valuable reference on a central object of algebraic and arithmetic geometry.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We give conditions for the Mayer-Vietoris property to hold for the algebraic K-theory of blow-up squares of toric varieties and schemes, using the theory of monoid schemes. These conditions are used to relate algebraic K-theory to topological cyclic homology in characteristic p. To achieve our goals, we develop many notions for monoid schemes based on classical algebraic geometry, such as separated and proper maps and resolution of singularities. The goal of this paper is to prove Haesemeyer's Theorem [18, 3.12] for toric schemes in any characteristic. It is proven below as Corollary 14.4. Theorem 0.1. Assume k is a commutative regular noetherian ring containing an infinite field and let G be a presheaf of spectra defined on the category of schemes of finite type over k. If G satisfies the Mayer-Vietoris property for Zariski covers, finite abstract blow-up squares, and blow-ups along regularly embedded closed subschemes, then G satisfies the Mayer-Vietoris property for all abstract blow-up squares of toric k-schemes obtained from subdividing a fan. The application we have in mind is to understand the relationship between the},

Math. 86 (1986) 287-346], it follows that such actions on geometric 3\textendash manifolds (in the sense of Thurston) are always geometric, ie there exist invariant locally homogeneous Riemannian metrics. This answers a question posed by Thurston [Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 6 (1982) 357-381].},

Here \$L\_\{\textbackslash mathbb A\^1\}\$ denotes the \$\textbackslash mathbb A\^1\$-localisation in the category of motivic spectra over a field \$k\$. Originally the same property was conjectured for the case of motivic \$S\^1\$-spectra over a base scheme \$S\$.In view of Ayoub's conterexamples the modified version of conjecture states that \$L\_\{\textbackslash mathbb A\^1\}(F)\$ is \$(-d)\$-connective for any connective \$F\$, where \$d=\textbackslash mathrm\{dim\} S\$ is the Krull dimension. The conjecture is proven under the infiniteness assumption on the residue fields for the cases of Dedekind schemes by J.\textasciitilde Schmidt and F.\textasciitilde Strunk and noetherian domains of arbitrary dimension by N.\textasciitilde Deshmukh, A.\textasciitilde Hogadi, G.\textasciitilde Kulkarni and S.\textasciitilde Yadavand. In the article we prove the result or general base with out the assumption on the residue fields. So by the result for any smooth scheme \$X\$ over a base scheme \$S\$ of Krull dimension \$d\$ the Nisnevich sheaves of \$S\^1\$-stable motivic homotopy groups \$\textbackslash pi\_i\^\{S\^1\}(X)\$ and \$\textbackslash mathbb P\^1\$-stable motivic homotopy groups \$\textbackslash pi\_\{i+j,j\}\^\{\textbackslash mathbb P\^1\}(X)\$ vanishes for all \$i{$<$}-d\$.},

With this new tool, we describe the cone of Betti tables of finite, minimal free complexes having homology modules of specified dimensions over a polynomial ring, and we treat many examples beyond polynomial rings. We also construct an analogue of our pairing between derived categories on a toric variety, yielding toric/multigraded analogues of the Eisenbud-Schreyer functionals.},

The book is written from the viewpoint of algebraic geometry and includes the theory of quadratic forms over fields of characteristic two, with proofs that are characteristic independent whenever possible. For some results both classical and geometric proofs are given. Part I includes classical algebraic theory of quadratic and bilinear forms and answers many questions that have been raised in the early stages of the development of the theory. Assuming only a basic course in algebraic geometry, Part II presents the necessary additional topics from algebraic geometry including the theory of Chow groups, Chow motives, and Steenrod operations. These topics are used in Part III to develop a modern geometric theory of quadratic forms.},

This generalizes the usual notion of involutions of Azumaya algebras over schemes with involution, which in turn generalizes the notion of involutions of central simple algebras. We provide a criterion to determine whether two Azumaya algebras with involutions extending \$\textbackslash lambda\$ are locally isomorphic, describe the equivalence classes obtained by this relation, and settle the question of when an Azumaya algebra \$A\$ is Brauer equivalent to an algebra carrying an involution extending \$\textbackslash lambda\$, by giving a cohomological condition. We remark that these results are novel even in the case of schemes, since we allow ramified, nontrivial involutions of the base object. We observe that, if the cohomological condition is satisfied, then \$A\$ is Brauer equivalent to an Azumaya algebra of degree \$2n\$ carrying an involution. By comparison with the case of topological spaces, we show that the integer \$2n\$ is minimal, even in the case of a nonsingular affine variety \$X\$ with a fixed-point free involution. As an incidental step, we show that if \$R\$ is a commutative ring with involution for which the fixed ring \$S\$ is local, then either \$R\$ is local or \$R/S\$ is a quadratic \textbackslash 'etale extension of rings.},

This generalizes the usual notion of involutions of Azumaya algebras over schemes with involution, which in turn generalizes the notion of involutions of central simple algebras. We provide a criterion to determine whether two Azumaya algebras with involutions extending \$\textbackslash lambda\$ are locally isomorphic, describe the equivalence classes obtained by this relation, and settle the question of when an Azumaya algebra \$A\$ is Brauer equivalent to an algebra carrying an involution extending \$\textbackslash lambda\$, by giving a cohomological condition. We remark that these results are novel even in the case of schemes, since we allow ramified, non-trivial involutions of the base object. We observe that, if the cohomological condition is satisfied, then \$A\$ is Brauer equivalent to an Azumaya algebra of degree \$2n\$ carrying an involution. By comparison with the case of topological spaces, we show that the integer \$2n\$ is minimal, even in the case of a nonsingular affine variety \$X\$ with a fixed-point free involution. As an incidental step, we show that if \$R\$ is a commutative ring with involution for which the fixed ring \$S\$ is local, then either \$R\$ is local or \$R/S\$ is a quadratic \textbackslash 'etale extension of rings.},

Roughly speaking, the classification decomposes to a finite number of steps. In each step we consider an open algebraic set M0n,2,r,{$\pi$} {$\subseteq$} Mn \texttimes{} Mn (Mn = the set of n \texttimes{} n complex-valued matrices). Here r and {$\pi$} are two positive integers. Then we construct a finite number of rational functions \o 1,\ldots,\o s in the entries of A and B whose values are constant on all pairs similar in Mn,2,r,{$\pi$} to (A, B). The values of the functions \o i(A, B), i = 1,\ldots, s, determine a finite number (at most {$\kappa$}(n, 2, r)) of similarity classes in Mn,2,r,{$\pi$}. Let Sn be the subspace of complex symmetric matrices in Mn. For (A, B) {$\epsilon$}Sn \texttimes{} Sn we consider the similarity class (TATt, TBTt), where T ranges over all complex orthogonal matrices. Then the characteristic polynomial |{$\lambda$}I - (A + xB)| determines a finite number of similarity classes for almost all pairs (A, B) {$\epsilon$}Sn \texttimes{} Sn.},

The aim of this book is to develop the combinatorics of Young tableaux and to show them in action in the algebra of symmetric functions, the representations of the symmetric and general linear groups, and the geometry of flag varieties. Many of these applications have not been available in book form. In the first part of the book the author develops the basic combinatorics of Young tableaux, including the remarkable constructions of "bumping" and "sliding" that can be used to make them into a monoid, and several interesting correspondences. In Part II these results are used to study representations of the symmetric and general linear groups. In Part III we see relations with geometry on Grassmanians and flag manifolds, including their Schubert subvarieties, and the related Schubert polynomials. Two appendices contain variations of the combinatorics of Part I and the topology needed to relate subvarieties to cohomology classes. The combinatorial chapters of the book are self-contained so that students will find the discussion easy to follow. Researchers in representation theory and algebraic geometry as well as in combinatorics will find Young Tableaux interesting and useful.},

Specifically, we will show that the varieties B\_n\^r(C) form homotopical approximations to the classifying space BPGL\_n(C). The varieties B\_n\^r(C) are obtained by first considering the variety of r-tuples of nxn complex matrices that generate the matrix algebra Mat\_n(C), and then taking the quotient by an evidently free PGL\_n(C)-action. The focus of this thesis is a computation of the singular cohomology groups of B\_n\^r(C) when n=2. We will show how these cohomological computations have applications in bounding the minimal number of generating sections of a topological Azumaya algebra over a paracompact space.},

  abstract = {Detecting structure in neural activity is critical for understanding the function of neural circuits. The coding properties of neurons are typically investigated by correlating their responses to external stimuli. It is not clear, however, if the structure of neural activity can be inferred intrinsically, without a priori knowledge of the relevant stimuli. We introduce a novel method, called clique topology, that detects intrinsic structure in neural activity that is invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations. Using pairwise correlations of neurons in the hippocampus, we demonstrate that our method is capable of detecting geometric structure from neural activity alone, without appealing to external stimuli or receptive fields., Detecting meaningful structure in neural activity and connectivity data is challenging in the presence of hidden nonlinearities, where traditional eigenvalue-based methods may be misleading. We introduce a novel approach to matrix analysis, called clique topology, that extracts features of the data invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations. These features can be used to detect both random and geometric structure, and depend only on the relative ordering of matrix entries. We then analyzed the activity of pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus, recorded while the animal was exploring a 2D environment, and confirmed that our method is able to detect geometric organization using only the intrinsic pattern of neural correlations. Remarkably, we found similar results during nonspatial behaviors such as wheel running and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This suggests that the geometric structure of correlations is shaped by the underlying hippocampal circuits and is not merely a consequence of position coding. We propose that clique topology is a powerful new tool for matrix analysis in biological settings, where the relationship of observed quantities to more meaningful variables is often nonlinear and unknown.},

  abstract = {The language of graph theory, or network science, has proven to be an exceptional tool for addressing myriad problems in neuroscience. Yet, the use of networks is predicated on a critical simplifying assumption: that the quintessential unit of interest in a brain is a dyad \textendash{} two nodes (neurons or brain regions) connected by an edge. While rarely mentioned, this fundamental assumption inherently limits the types of neural structure and function that graphs can be used to model. Here, we describe a generalization of graphs that overcomes these limitations, thereby offering a broad range of new possibilities in terms of modeling and measuring neural phenomena. Specifically, we explore the use of simplicial complexes: a structure developed in the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, of increasing applicability to real data due to a rapidly growing computational toolset. We review the underlying mathematical formalism as well as the budding literature applying simplicial complexes to neural data, from electrophysiological recordings in animal models to hemodynamic fluctuations in humans. Based on the exceptional flexibility of the tools and recent ground-breaking insights into neural function, we posit that this framework has the potential to eclipse graph theory in unraveling the fundamental mysteries of cognition.},

  abstract = {In the past 50 or 60 years, developments in mathematics have led to innovations in linear algebra and matrix theory. This progress was often initiated by topics and problems from applied mathematics. A good example of this is the development of mathematical systems theory. In particular, many new and important results in linear algebra cannot even be formulated without the notion of invariant subspaces of matrices or linear transformations. In view of this, the authors set out to write a work on advanced linear algebra in which invariant subspaces of matrices would be the central notion, the main subject of research, and the main tool. In other words, matrix theory was to be presented entirely on the basis of the theory of invariant subspaces, including the algebraic, geometric, topological, and analytic aspects of the theory. We believed that this would give a new point of view and a better understanding of the entire subject. It would also allow us to follow up systematically the central role of invariant subspaces in linear algebra and matrix analysis, as well as their role in the study of differential and difference equations, systems theory, matrix polynomials, rational matrix functions, and algebraic Riccati equations. The first edition of the present book was the result. To the authors' knowledge it is the only book in existence with these aims. The first parts of the book have the character of a textbook easily accessible for undergraduate students. As the development progresses, the exposition changes to approach the style and content of a graduate textbook and even a research monograph until, in the last part, recent achievements are presented. The fundamental character of the mathematics, its accessibility, and its importance in applications makes this a widely useful book for experts and for students in mathematics, sciences, and engineering. The first edition sold out in early 2005, and we could not help colleagues who found a need for it. We are grateful to Wiley-Interscience publications for producing the first edition and for returning the copyright to us in order to give the work a new life. We are especially thankful to SIAM for the decision to include this work in their series Classics in Applied Mathematics. We would like to mention some other literature with strong connections to this book. First, there are two other relevant monographs by the present authors: Matrix Polynomials, published by Academic Press in 1982, and Matrices and Indefinite Scalar Products, published by Birkh\"auser Verlag in 1983. Invariant subspaces play an important role in both of them. In fact, work on these two books convinced us of the need for the present systematic treatment.},

If the complex codimension of \$V\$ is one, then one shows that each cohomology class of \$W - V\$ can be represented by a differential form of the type \$\textbackslash theta \textbackslash wedge \textbackslash lambda + \textbackslash eta\$ where \$\textbackslash lambda\$ is the kernel associated to \$V\$ and \$\textbackslash theta \textbackslash mid V\$ is the Poincar\'e residue of this class.},

Tentatively, the new features of the book are: 1. Footnotes containing biographical information and portraits 2. A new chapter on mean-value theorems 3. A new appendix on plotting tubes " That September he spent a week in Valencia, participating in a workshop on Differential Geometry and its Applications. Here he gave me a copy of the last version of Tubes. It could be considered a final version. There was only one point that we thought needed to be considered again, namely the possible completion of the material in Section 8. 8 on comparison theorems of surfaces with the now well-known results in arbitrary dimensions. But only one month later the sad and shocking news arrived from Bilbao: Alfred had passed away. I was subsequently charged with the task of preparing the final revision of the book for the publishers, although some special circumstances prevented me from finishing the task earlier. The book appears essentially as Alred Gray left it in September 1998. The only changes I carried out were the addition of Section 8. 9 (representing the discus- sion we had), the inclusion of some new results on harmonic spaces, the structure of Hopf hypersurfaces in complex projective spaces and the conjecture about the volume of geodesic balls.},

Throughout this paper, p is a fixed prime, and k is a field of characteristic 0, containing the p-th roots of unity. We fix an integer n {$\geq$} 2 and an n-tuple (a1,..., an) of units in k, such that the symbol \{a\}  = \{a1,..., an\} is nontrivial in the Milnor K-group KM n (k)/p. Associated to this data are several notions. A field F over k is a splitting field for \{a\} if \{a\}F = 0 in KM n (F)/p. A variety X over k is called a splitting variety if its function field is a splitting field; X is p-generic if any splitting field F has a finite extension E/F of degree prime to p with X(E) {$\not$} = {$\varnothing$}. A norm variety for \{a\} is a smooth projective p-generic splitting variety for \{a\} of dimension pn-1-1. The following sequence of theorems reduces the Bloch-Kato conjecture to the},

In particular, the theory of matrix Lie groups and their Lie algebras is developed using only linear algebra, and more motivation and intuition for proofs is provided than in most classic texts on the subject. In addition to its accessible treatment of the basic theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, the book is also noteworthy for including: a treatment of the Baker\textendash Campbell\textendash Hausdorff formula and its use in place of the Frobenius theorem to establish deeper results about the relationship between Lie groups and Lie algebras motivation for the machinery of roots, weights and the Weyl group via a concrete and detailed exposition of the representation theory of sl(3;C) an unconventional definition of semisimplicity that allows for a rapid development of the structure theory of semisimple Lie algebras a self-contained construction of the representations of compact groups, independent of Lie-algebraic arguments The second edition of Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations contains many substantial improvements and additions, among them: an entirely new part devoted to the structure and representation theory of compact Lie groups; a complete derivation of the main properties of root systems; the construction of finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras has been elaborated; a treatment of universal enveloping algebras, including a proof of the Poincar\'e\textendash Birkhoff\textendash Witt theorem and the existence of Verma modules; complete proofs of the Weyl character formula, the Weyl dimension formula and the Kostant multiplicity formula. Review of the first edition: ``This is an excellent book. It deserves to, and undoubtedly will, become the standard text for early graduate courses in Lie group theory . an important addition to the textbook literature . it is highly recommended.'' \textemdash{} The Mathematical Gazette.},

Since this goal is shared by quite a few other books, we should explain in this Preface how our approach differs, although the potential reader can probably see this better by a quick browse through the book. Representation theory is simple to define: it is the study of the ways in which a given group may act on vector spaces. It is almost certainly unique, however, among such clearly delineated subjects, in the breadth of its interest to mathematicians. This is not surprising: group actions are ubiquitous in 20th century mathematics, and where the object on which a group acts is not a vector space, we have learned to replace it by one that is \{e. g. , a cohomology group, tangent space, etc. \}. As a consequence, many mathematicians other than specialists in the field \{or even those who think they might want to be\} come in contact with the subject in various ways. It is for such people that this text is designed. To put it another way, we intend this as a book for beginners to learn from and not as a reference. This idea essentially determines the choice of material covered here. As simple as is the definition of representation theory given above, it fragments considerably when we try to get more specific.},

This implies that the diagonal of a Reedy fibrant multicosimplicial object is a Reedy fibrant cosimplicial object, which has applications to the calculus of functors. We also show that, although the diagonal functor is a Quillen functor, it is not a Quillen equivalence for multicosimplicial spaces. We also discuss total objects and homotopy limits of multicosimplicial objects. We show that the total object of a multicosimplicial object is isomorphic to the total object of the diagonal, and that the diagonal embedding of the cosimplicial indexing category into the multicosimplicial indexing category is homotopy left cofinal, which implies that the homotopy limits are weakly equivalent if the multicosimplicial object is at least objectwise fibrant.},

Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematics, and the necessary material has only occurred sporadically in the literature and university curricula. As the interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and a reference work offering a broad selection of topics has become apparent, and this book aims to meet that need. This book will be welcomed as an undergraduate or graduate textbook for students studying matrix analysis. The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. They begin with a review and discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The following chapters each treat a major topic in depth. This volume should be useful not only as a text, but also as a self-contained reference work to a variety of audiences in other scientific fields.}

When working with rational coefficients, we prove that the motive of the stack of bundles lies in the localizing tensor subcategory generated by the motive of the curve, using Bia\l ynicki-Birula decompositions of these Quot schemes. We conjecture a formula for the motive of this stack, inspired by the work of Atiyah and Bott on the topology of the classifying space of the gauge group, and we prove this conjecture modulo a conjecture on the intersection theory of the Quot schemes.},

This folk theorem is apparently due to Joyal, and has been generalized recently by Beke. However, in most cases of interest, such as the category of sheaves on a ringed space or the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a nice enough scheme, the abelian category in question also has a tensor product. The injective model structure is not well-suited to the tensor product. In this paper, we consider another method for constructing a model structure. We apply it to the category of sheaves on a well-behaved ringed space. The resulting flat model structure is compatible with the tensor product and all homomorphisms of ringed spaces.}

In the second model structure, fibrant replacement is essentially just the Bousfield-Kan R-tower. When the first homotopy category is equivalent to a homotopy theory defined by Morel but has some convenient categorical advantages.},

In fact the method applies without restriction on \$X\$ whenever \$G\$ is a \$p\$-group and \$Y\$ is \$p\$-complete and satisfies standard finiteness assumptions. The method is an Adams spectral sequence based on a new equivariant cohomology theory \$c\^\textbackslash ast(X)\$ which we introduce in \$\textbackslash S1\$. This spectral sequence is quite calculable and provides a natural generalisation of the classical Adams spectral sequence based on ordinary \$\textbackslash operatorname\{mod\}p\$ cohomology. It also geometrically realises certain inverse limits of nonequivariant Adams spectral sequences which have been useful in the study of the Segal conjecture [19, 5, 21, 9].},

  abstract = {This monograph on the homotopy theory of topologized diagrams of spaces and spectra gives an expert account of a subject at the foundation of motivic homotopy theory and the theory of topological modular forms in stable homotopy theory. Beginning with an introduction to the homotopy theory of simplicial sets and topos theory, the book covers core topics such as the unstable homotopy theory of simplicial presheaves and sheaves, localized theories, cocycles, descent theory, non-abelian cohomology, stacks, and local stable homotopy theory. A detailed treatment of the formalism of the subject is interwoven with explanations of the motivation, development, and nuances of ideas and results. The coherence of the abstract theory is elucidated through the use of widely applicable tools, such as Barr's theorem on Boolean localization, model structures on the category of simplicial presheaves on a site, and cocycle categories. A wealth of concrete examples convey the vitality and importance of the subject in topology, number theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic K-theory. Assuming basic knowledge of algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, Local Homotopy Theory will appeal to researchers and advanced graduate students seeking to understand and advance the applications of homotopy theory in multiple areas of mathematics and the mathematical sciences.},

  abstract = {Prolonged deprivation of auditory input can change brain networks in pre- and postlingual deaf adults by brain-wide reorganization. To investigate morphological changes in these brains voxel-based morphometry, voxel-wise correlation with the primary auditory cortex, and whole brain network analyses using morphological covariance were performed in eight prelingual deaf, eleven postlingual deaf, and eleven hearing adults. Network characteristics based on graph theory and network filtration based on persistent homology were examined. Gray matter density in the primary auditor cortex was preserved in prelingual deafness, while it tended to decrease in postlingual deafness. Unlike postlingual, prelingual deafness showed increased bilateral temporal connectivity of the primary auditory cortex compared to the hearing adults. Of the graph theory-based characteristics, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and nodal efficiency all increased in prelingual deafness, while all the parameters of postlingual deafness were similar to the hearing adults. Patterns of connected components changing during network filtration were different between prelingual deafness and hearing adults according to the barcode, dendrogram, and single linkage matrix representations, while these were the same in postlingual deafness. Nodes in fronto-limbic and left temporal components were closely coupled, and nodes in the temporo-parietal component were loosely coupled, in prelingual deafness. Patterns of connected components changing in postlingual deafness were the same as hearing adults. We propose that the preserved density of auditory cortex associated with increased connectivity in prelingual deafness, and closer coupling between certain brain areas, represent distinctive reorganization of auditory and related cortices compared with hearing or postlingual deaf adults. The differential network reorganization in the prelingual deaf adults could be related to the absence of auditory speech experience.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to present a new view on the link between the well known K-theory of finitely generated projective modules and much less understood K-theory of Hermitian forms on finitely generated projective modules.For a given Hermitian ring (R, {$\alpha$}, {$\in$}), we obtain the K-theory space KR equipped with an involution and the Hermitian K-theory space KHerm(R, {$\alpha$}, {$\in$}). The fixed subspace  \$\$KR\$\$  \$\$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\$\$  2 is homotopy equivalent to the Hermitian K-theory space KHerm(R,, {$\alpha$}, {$\in$}). We construct the Karoubi Tower diagram, which is obtained by iterating Karoubi's construction of the homotopy fibers of the forgetful and hyperbolic maps. Using an interesting factorization of these maps, we prove various homotopy properties of the Karoubi Tower. The homotopy inverse limit of the Karoubi Tower is homotopy equivalent to the homotopy fibre of the inclusion of the fixed set  \$\$KR\$\$  \$\$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\$\$  2 into the homotopy fixed set  \$\$KR\$\$  h  \$\$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\$\$  2. Considering Karoubi's fundamental periodicity theorem, the Karoubi Tower generalizes the low dimensional connections between Hermitian K-theory and K-theory groups. Illustrative examples of the Karoubi Tower are given by the finite field case and the classical Hermitian rings over  \$\$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$\$  ,  \$\$\textbackslash mathbb\{C\}\$\$  and  \$\$\textbackslash mathbb\{H\}\$\$  . Considering topological K-theory for these cases, the Karoubi Tower comprises the classical Bott periodicity.Another important application of the Karoubi Tower is an elegant and comprehensive generalization of the classical invariants of quadratic forms.},

A special case is the following result. Call a morphism \$\textbackslash phi: X \textbackslash to Y\$ a "fibration with fiber \$F\$" if \$\textbackslash phi\$ is flat and all fibers are (reduced and) isomorphic to \$F\$. Then an affine fibration with fiber \$F\$ admits an etale dominant morphism \$\textbackslash mu: U \textbackslash to Y\$ such that the pull-back is a trivial fiber bundle: \$U\textbackslash times\_Y X \textbackslash simeq U\textbackslash times F\$. As an application we give short proofs of the following two (known) results: (a) Every affine \$\textbackslash A\^1\$-fibration over a normal variety is locally trivial in the Zariski-topology; (b) Every affine \$\textbackslash A\^2\$-fibration over a smooth curve is locally trivial in the Zariski-topology. We also study families of reductive group actions on \$\textbackslash A\^2\$ parametrized by curves and show that every faithful action of a non-finite reductive group on \$\textbackslash AA\^3\$ is linearizable, i.e. \$G\$-isomorphic to a representation of \$G\$.},

The theorem generalizes a result by C. Dwyer, who has proven the theorem for finite G and twistings of a more restricted type. While versions of the general result have been known to experts, to our knowledge no proof appears in the current literature. Our goal is to fill in this gap. The proof we give proceeds in two stages. We first prove the theorem in the case of a twisting arising from a graded central extension of G, following the Adams-Haeberly-Jackowski-May proof of the classical Atiyah-Segal completion theorem. After establishing that the theorem holds for this special class of twistings, we then deduce the general theorem by a Mayer-Vietoris argument.},

The latest, expanded edition offers three new chapters on Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometry, and revised sections on sprays and Stokes' theorem.;This is the third version of a book on differential manifolds. The first version appeared in 1962, and was written at the very beginning of a period of great expansion of the subject. At the time, I found no satisfactory book for the foundations of the subject, for multiple reasons. I expanded the book in 1971, and I expand it still further today. Specifically, I have added three chapters on Riemannian and pseudo Riemannian geometry, that is, covariant derivatives, curvature, and some applications up to the Hopf-Rinow and Hadamard-Cartan theorems, as well as some calculus of variations and applications to volume forms. I have rewritten the sections on sprays, and I have given more examples of the use of Stokes' theorem. I have also given many more references to the literature, all of this to broaden the perspective of the book, which I hope can be used among things for a general course leading into many directions. The present book still meets the old needs, but fulfills new ones. At the most basic level, the book gives an introduction to the basic concepts which are used in differential topology, differential geometry, and differential equations. In differential topology, one studies for instance homotopy classes of maps and the possibility of finding suitable differentiable maps in them (immersions, embeddings, isomorphisms, etc.).;},

It draws its inspiration from areas as diverse as topology, quantum algebra, mathematical physics, logic, and theoretical computer science. The heart of this book is the language of generalized operads. This is as natural and transparent a language for higher category theory as the language of sheaves is for algebraic geometry, or vector spaces for linear algebra. It is introduced carefully, then used to give simple descriptions of a variety of higher categorical structures. In particular, one possible definition of n-category is discussed in detail, and some common aspects of other possible definitions are established. This is the first book on the subject and lays its foundations. It will appeal to both graduate students and established researchers who wish to become acquainted with this modern branch of mathematics.},

  abstract = {We construct and describe compactified moduli stacks of Azumaya algebras on a smooth projective morphism X [right arrow] S. These stacks are the algebro-geometric version of the (suitably compactified) stacks of principal PGLn-bundles and they also have strong connections to arithmetic. A geometric approach to the problem leads one to study stacks of (semistable) twisted sheaves. We show that these stacks are very similar to the stacks of semistable sheaves. This gives a way of understanding the structure of the stack of principal PGLn-bundles and its coarse moduli space in terms of fairly well-understood spaces. In particular, when X [right arrow] S is a smooth projective curve or surface over an algebraically closed field, our method yields concrete theorems about the structure of these stacks (at least as certain natural invariants are allowed to increase without bound). On the arithmetic side, we use the geometry and rationality properties of these moduli spaces to study a classical question about the Brauer group of a function field K, known as the "period-index problem": for which classes o in Br(K) of order n does there exist a division algebra D of rank n2 with [D] = [alpha]? We give an answer to this question when K is the function field of a curve or surface over an algebraically closed, finite, or local field and when c is an unramified Brauer class of order prime to the characteristic of K. In the general case, we relate the unramified period-index problem to rationality questions on Galois twists of moduli spaces of semistable sheaves.},

Under reasonable assumptions on \$E\$ and \$X\$ we show that these two operations coincide and can be expressed in terms of formal completions or localizations in the usual sense of commutative algebra.

  abstract = {Algebraic groups play much the same role for algebraists as Lie groups play for analysts. This book is the first comprehensive introduction to the theory of algebraic group schemes over fields that includes the structure theory of semisimple algebraic groups, and is written in the language of modern algebraic geometry. The first eight chapters study general algebraic group schemes over a field and culminate in a proof of the Barsotti\textendash Chevalley theorem, realizing every algebraic group as an extension of an abelian variety by an affine group. After a review of the Tannakian philosophy, the author provides short accounts of Lie algebras and finite group schemes. The later chapters treat reductive algebraic groups over arbitrary fields, including the Borel\textendash Chevalley structure theory. Solvable algebraic groups are studied in detail. Prerequisites have also been kept to a minimum so that the book is accessible to non-specialists in algebraic geometry.},

This is only a modest improvement of the theorem of Gordeev and Popov (2003), but it allows us to give a new characterization of algebraic Lie algebras and to simplify the standard descriptions of Mumford--Tate domains and Shimura varieties as moduli spaces. Once the original argument of Gordeev and Popov has been rewritten in the language of schemes, we find that it also applies to algebraic groups over discrete valuation rings.},

Up to isomorphism, the algebra \$\textbackslash operatorname\{Mat\}\_\{n \textbackslash times n\}(k)\$ can be endowed with a \$k\$-linear involution in one way if \$n\$ is odd and in two ways if \$n\$ is even. In this paper, we consider \$r\$-tuples \$A\_\textbackslash bullet \textbackslash in \textbackslash operatorname\{Mat\}\_\{n\textbackslash times n\}(k)\^r\$ such that the entries of \$A\_\textbackslash bullet\$ fail to generate \$\textbackslash operatorname\{Mat\}\_\{n\textbackslash times n\}(k)\$ as an algebra with involution. We show that the locus of such \$r\$-tuples forms a closed subvariety \$Z(r;V)\$ of \$\textbackslash operatorname\{Mat\}\_\{n\textbackslash times n\}(k)\^r\$ that is not irreducible. We describe the irreducible components and we calculate the dimension of the largest component of \$Z(r;V)\$ in all cases. This gives a numerical answer to the question of how generic it is for an \$r\$-tuple \$(a\_1, \textbackslash dots, a\_r)\$ of elements in \$\textbackslash operatorname\{Mat\}\_\{n\textbackslash times n\}(k)\$ to generate it as an algebra with involution.},

Up to isomorphism, the algebra Matn\texttimes n⁡(k) can be endowed with a k-linear involution in one way if n is odd and in two ways if n is even. In this paper, we consider r-tuples A{$\bullet\in$}Matn\texttimes n⁡(k)r such that the entries of A{$\bullet$} fail to generate Matn\texttimes n⁡(k) as an algebra with involution. We show that the locus of such r-tuples forms a closed subvariety Z(r;V) of Matn\texttimes n⁡(k)r that is not irreducible. We describe the irreducible components and we calculate the dimension of the largest component of Z(r;V) in all cases. This gives a numerical answer to the question of how generic it is for an r-tuple (a1,\ldots,ar) of elements in Matn\texttimes n⁡(k) to generate it as an algebra with involution.},

  abstract = {High-throughput biological data, whether generated as sequencing, transcriptional microarrays, proteomic, or other means, continues to require analytic methods that address its high dimensional aspects. Because the computational part of data analysis ultimately identifies shape characteristics in the organization of data sets, the mathematics of shape recognition in high dimensions continues to be a crucial part of data analysis. This article introduces a method that extracts information from high-throughput microarray data and, by using topology, provides greater depth of information than current analytic techniques. The method, termed Progression Analysis of Disease (PAD), first identifies robust aspects of cluster analysis, then goes deeper to find a multitude of biologically meaningful shape characteristics in these data. Additionally, because PAD incorporates a visualization tool, it provides a simple picture or graph that can be used to further explore these data. Although PAD can be applied to a wide range of high-throughput data types, it is used here as an example to analyze breast cancer transcriptional data. This identified a unique subgroup of Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers that express high levels of c-MYB and low levels of innate inflammatory genes. These patients exhibit 100\% survival and no metastasis. No supervised step beyond distinction between tumor and healthy patients was used to identify this subtype. The group has a clear and distinct, statistically significant molecular signature, it highlights coherent biology but is invisible to cluster methods, and does not fit into the accepted classification of Luminal A/B, Normal-like subtypes of ER+ breast cancers. We denote the group as c-MYB+ breast cancer.},

Another advantage of this approach is that the slices appear naturally as homotopy fibres (and not as in the stable setting, where they are defined as homotopy cofibres) which behave much better in the unstable setting.},

The main theorem of this paper gives an equivalence between the homotopy theory of diagrams of spaces based on a topological category and the homotopy theory of CW complexes over the same base category.             A brief description of the paper goes as follows: in Section 1 we introduce the homotopy category of diagrams of spaces based on a fixed topological category. In Section 2 homotopy groups for diagrams are defined. These are used to define the concept of weak equivalence and J-n equivalence that generalize the classical definition. In Section 3 we adapt the classical theory of CW complexes to develop a cellular theory for diagrams. In Section 4 we use sheaf theory to define a reasonable cohomology theory of diagrams and compare it to previously defined theories. In Section 5 we define a closed model category structure for the homotopy theory of diagrams. We show this Quillen type homotopy theory is equivalent to the homotopy theory of J-CW complexes. In Section 6 we apply our constructions and results to prove a useful result in equivariant homotopy theory originally proved by Elmendorf by a different method.},

We show that this model category is a \$t\$-complete model topos and describe the Grothendieck topology \$[\textbackslash tau]\$ on the homotopy category of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\$ that corresponds to this model topos. After we first review a proof showing that the motivic homotopy theory is not a model topos, we specialize this construction to the category of smooth schemes of finite type, which is simplicially enriched using the standard algebraic cosimplicial object, and compare the result with the motivic homotopy theory. We also collect some partial positive results on the exactness properties of the motivic localization functor.},

We apply our approach to neural recordings of mice moving freely in a box, where we find a circular feature. We then observe that the decoded value corresponds well to the head direction of the mouse. Thus, we capture head direction cells and decode the head direction from the neural population activity without having to process the mouse's behavior. Interestingly, the decoded values convey more information about the neural activity than the tracked head direction does, with differences that have some spatial organization. Finally, we note that the residual population activity, after the head direction has been accounted for, retains some low-dimensional structure that is correlated with the speed of the mouse.},

Antieau and Meier showed that if \$k\$ is an algebraically closed field of \$\textbackslash on\{char\} k \textbackslash ne 2\$, then \$\textbackslash Br(\textbackslash ms\{M\}\_\{1,1,k\}) = 0\$, where \$\textbackslash ms\{M\}\_\{1,1\}\$ is the moduli stack of elliptic curves. We show that if \$\textbackslash on\{char\} k = 2\$ then \$\textbackslash Br(\textbackslash ms\{M\}\_\{1,1,k\}) = \textbackslash Z/(2)\$. In another direction, we compute the cohomological Brauer group of \$\textbackslash G\_\{m\}\$-gerbes; this is an analogue of a result of Gabber which computes the cohomological Brauer group of Brauer-Severi schemes. We also discuss two kinds of algebraic stacks \$X\$ for which not all torsion classes in \$\textbackslash H\_\{\textbackslash et\}\^\{2\}(X,\textbackslash G\_\{m\})\$ are represented by Azumaya algebras on \$X\$ (i.e. \$\textbackslash Br \textbackslash ne \textbackslash Br'\$).},

We also prove a new version of the classical result that spaces parametrized over X are equivalent to spaces with an action of {$\Omega$}X.

The major topics include, after a brief review of the standard model and its unification into a simple group, the use of Dynkin diagrams to analyze the structure of the group generators and to keep track of the weights (quantum numbers) of the representation vectors; an analysis of the subgroup structure of simple groups, including explicit coordinatizations of the projections in weight space; lists of representations, tensor products and branching rules for a number of simple groups; and other details about groups and their representations that are often helpful for surveying unified models, including vector-coupling coefficient calculations. Tabulations of representations, tensor products, and branching rules for E  6, SO  10, SU  6, F  4, SO  9, SU  5, SO  8, SO  7, SU  4, E  7, E  8, SU  8, SO  18, SO  22, and for completeness, SU  3 are included.

  abstract = {This book is based on the notes of the authors' seminar on algebraic and Lie groups held at the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow University in 1967/68. Our guiding idea was to present in the most economic way the theory of semisimple Lie groups on the basis of the theory of algebraic groups. Our main sources were A. Borel's paper [34], C. ChevalIey's seminar [14], seminar "Sophus Lie" [15] and monographs by C. Chevalley [4], N. Jacobson [9] and J-P. Serre [16, 17]. In preparing this book we have completely rearranged these notes and added two new chapters: "Lie groups" and "Real semisimple Lie groups". Several traditional topics of Lie algebra theory, however, are left entirely disregarded, e.g. universal enveloping algebras, characters of linear representations and (co)homology of Lie algebras. A distinctive feature of this book is that almost all the material is presented as a sequence of problems, as it had been in the first draft of the seminar's notes. We believe that solving these problems may help the reader to feel the seminar's atmosphere and master the theory. Nevertheless, all the non-trivial ideas, and sometimes solutions, are contained in hints given at the end of each section. The proofs of certain theorems, which we consider more difficult, are given directly in the main text. The book also contains exercises, the majority of which are an essential complement to the main contents.},

  abstract = {A portrait of the subject of homological algebra as it exists today.;The landscape of homological algebra has evolved over the last half-century into a fundamental tool for the working mathematician. This book provides a unified account of homological algebra as it exists today. The historical connection with topology, regular local rings, and semi-simple Lie algebras are also described. This book is suitable for second or third year graduate students. The first half of the book takes as its subject the canonical topics in homological algebra: derived functors, Tor and Ext, projective dimensions and spectral sequences. Homology of group and Lie algebras illustrate these topics. Intermingled are less canonical topics, such as the derived inverse limit functor lim1, local cohomology, Galois cohomology, and affine Lie algebras. The last part of the book covers less traditional topics that are a vital part of the modern homological toolkit: simplicial methods, Hochschild and cyclic homology, derived categories and total derived functors. By making these tools more accessible, the book helps to break down the technological barrier between experts and casual users of homological algebra.;},

Namely let R be a local regular ring of geometric type and let F be a covariant functor from the category of R-algebras to Abelian groups that has a structure of transfer map. We prove that purity holds for the functor F. Applying this general result to different examples of functors, we obtain new uniform proofs of known results, as well as new versions of purity.},
